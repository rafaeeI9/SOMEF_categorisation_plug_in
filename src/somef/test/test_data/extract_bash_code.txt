Another solution is to run Node directly with the `--max-old-space-size` option. The following example (Mac or Linux) allocates 16GB of memory:
```bash
$ node  --max-old-space-size=16000 `which mapshaper` <mapshaper commands>
```

## Installation

Mapshaper requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

With Node installed, you can install the latest release version of mapshaper using npm. Install with the "-g" flag to make the executable scripts available systemwide.

```bash
npm install -g mapshaper
```

To install and run the latest development code from github:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mbloch/mapshaper.git
cd mapshaper
npm install       # install dependencies
npm run build     # bundle source code files
npm link          # (optional) add global symlinks so scripts are available systemwide
```

## Building and testing

From the project directory, run `npm run build` to build both the cli and web UI modules.

Run `npm test` to run mapshaper's tests.
