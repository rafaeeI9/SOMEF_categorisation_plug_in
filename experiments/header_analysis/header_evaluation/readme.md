## Deatils about the header evaluation analysis.

This folder contains the results on the header extraction over the respositories that are part of our corpus. The files:

- header_evaluation.csv
- header_evaluation_summary.csv

Are part of our initial evaluation, which had to be assessed manually over the full repository list in an interactive mode.

The second set of files:

- header_evaluation_new_header_content.csv
- header_evaluation_new_header_content_content.csv

Contain the headers of all the repositories with their correct label, and the content of the respective section with the correct label as well (sometimes there may be a disagreement between the content of the section and its header). Both of these files are used to generate dynamic results of the evaluation when new improvements are added.
