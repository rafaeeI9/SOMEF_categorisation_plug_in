https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,Rosna Thomas,"At its core, this tool uses xpaths of 'divs' to extract data from them. Since Facebook keeps on updating its site frequently and the 'divs' get changed. Consequently, we have to update the divs accordingly to correctly scrape the data. "
https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,Rosna Thomas,"The developers of this tool have devoted a lot of time and effort in developing and most importantly maintaining this tool for quite a lot time now. In order to keep this amazing tool alive, we need support from you geeks."
https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,Rosna Thomas,"The code is pretty intuitive and easy to understand, so you can update the relevant xpaths in the code when you feel that you have tried many profiles and the data isn't being scraped for any of them (that's a hint that Facebook has updated their site) and generate a pull request. That's quite an easy thing to do. Thanks!"
